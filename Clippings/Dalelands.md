The **Dalelands**, also referred to as **the Dales**, was a region in [north Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/North_Faer%C3%BBn "North Faerûn") of dense forests and bountiful, rolling farmlands.[^1] It comprised a loosely-organized group of countries called *dales* that were as diverse as they were independent.[^4]

“

*The people of the Dales didn’t survive so near dangers like the [Zhentarim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentarim "Zhentarim") and [Myth Drannor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myth_Drannor "Myth Drannor") by being trusting. We go through life with our eyes open.*

”

## Geography

The Dalelands were located around and partially within the [Cormanthor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthor "Cormanthor") forest, west of the [Sea of Fallen Stars](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Fallen_Stars "Sea of Fallen Stars"). They were neighbored to the southwest by the kingdom of [Cormyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormyr "Cormyr"), to the south by the nation of [Sembia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sembia "Sembia"), and to northwest by the [Desertsmouth Mountains](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Desertsmouth_Mountains "Desertsmouth Mountains") and beyond them the [Anauroch](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anauroch "Anauroch") desert.[^7]

### Geographical Features

- [Arch Wood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arch_Wood "Arch Wood"): Rumored to be haunted, this dark, dense forest was full of [oak](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Oak "Oak"), [ash](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ash "Ash") and [elm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elm "Elm") and home to ferocious [owlbears](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Owlbear "Owlbear").[^8] Its trees spanned the borders of Archendale, Deepingdale and Tasseldale and played a major role in the lives of their people, both socially and economically. Woodcutting was almost always prohibited, despite the constant pleas of Archendale during the annual Dales Council.[^9]
- [River Ashaba](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/River_Ashaba "River Ashaba"): This massive river flowed from the [Desertsmouth Mountains](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Desertsmouth_Mountains "Desertsmouth Mountains"), through nearly half the dales, over [Feather Falls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Feather_Falls_\(waterfall\) "Feather Falls (waterfall)") and into [the Scar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Scar "The Scar") before emptying into the [Dragon Reach](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Reach "Dragon Reach") fjord off the [Sea of Fallen Stars](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Fallen_Stars "Sea of Fallen Stars").[^10] A number of villages and towns, including [Feather Falls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Feather_Falls_\(village\) "Feather Falls (village)"),[^11] [Chandlerscross](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chandlerscross "Chandlerscross"),[^12] and [Scardale Town](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scardale_Town "Scardale Town") [^13] rested on or straddled this river and attributed at least part of their economy to its prominence throughout the dale, especially [Featherdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Featherdale "Featherdale").[^10]
- [Thunder Peaks](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Peaks "Thunder Peaks"): These massive mountains spanned the southern border of the dales, separating them from the nation of Cormyr. They were rich in [copper](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Copper "Copper") and [iron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron "Iron") and mostly uninhabited, save for a few tribes of [hobgoblins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hobgoblin "Hobgoblin"), [hill giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hill_giant "Hill giant"),[^14] and the family of [wyverns](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wyvern "Wyvern") who took roost in one its tallest peaks.[^15] The mountains received their names from the year-round thunderstorms [^14] that would close [Tilver's Gap](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tilver%27s_Gap "Tilver's Gap") and [Thunder Gap](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Gap "Thunder Gap") with snow during the winter.[^16]

## Culture

While the various dales shared a similar culture, alike lifestyles and aligned relationships with nearby powers, they were not a unified nation like nearby [Cormyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormyr "Cormyr") and [Sembia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sembia "Sembia").[^4] Each dale was an independent territory with its own unique government, military, industry and culture. However, the people were largely independent, self-reliant and had collectively enjoyed an age-old alliance with the [elves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elves "Elves") of [Cormanthyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthyr "Cormanthyr"),[^1] in thanks to the Dales Compact.[^2]

Travelers visiting the Dalelands might see the folk as reserved, suspicious [^1] or even as "country bumpkins".[^17] They were a quiet people who typically preferred to remain civil, silent and deliberate about someone's character until they were well enough known to be accepted as a friend, or even an ally. Once this trust was earned, friends of the Dalesfolk would find them to be quite open and generous.[^1]

Farming, craftsmanship and commerce were all highly valued throughout the dales.[^1] Honest and hearty, the Dalesfolk had firmly-held beliefs that their industriousness and virtue would overcome any foreign schemes and exotic [magic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") that attempted to sway their land.[^18]

## Government

First and foremost the Dalelands were a loose confederation of small towns.[^19] The one thing they were not, and perhaps have never been, was a unified kingdom.[^1] Each dale maintained their own militia [^1] and government, whether a lordship like [Shadowdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowdale "Shadowdale") [^4] or a republic led by groups such as the [Swords of Archendale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Swords_of_Archendale "Swords of Archendale").[^20]

However, representatives from each dale would meet together once a year in [Midwinter](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Midwinter "Midwinter") to discuss issues related to trade, relations with other nations, and inter-border disputes at the [Dales Council](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dales_Council "Dales Council").[^2] While the debates would often dissolve into pointless arguing and bickering, in the face of a common foe, such as attempted annexations by Sembia or the discovery of Zhentarim schemes, the dales would band together as a unified force. The council could also be called in the face of an emergency that threatened the region as a whole.[^21]

## Trade

Trade was an important, and often unifying, force among the various dales. The main exports of the Dalelands were raw products and materials,[^19] such as timber and seafood from Archendale,[^22] livestock, cheese and grain from [Battledale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battledale "Battledale"),[^23] or [copper](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Copper "Copper") from [High Dale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/High_Dale "High Dale"). [^24] The Dalelands were essentially considered the breadbasket of the [Western Heartlands](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Western_Heartlands "Western Heartlands").[^1]

The exception to this dynamic was [Tasseldale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tasseldale "Tasseldale"), which was a land of primarily craftsmen and traders, taking a cue from their neighbor Sembia, and primarily exported fine goods like pottery and textiles.[^25] Conversely, these fine goods, including metalwork, jewelry and finished products like paper, glassware and clothing were usually highest in demand within the other dales. These goods were procured from nearby cities such as [Arabel](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arabel "Arabel"), [Suzail](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Suzail "Suzail") and [Marsember](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marsember "Marsember") in Cormyr, [Hillsfar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hillsfar "Hillsfar") from the [Moonsea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonsea "Moonsea") region and [Selgaunt](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Selgaunt "Selgaunt") and [Ordulin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ordulin "Ordulin"), when it was still a city of Sembia.[^26]

In addition, the Dalelands acted as a crossroads of trade.[^26] Although their people cared little for foreign affairs, their strategic location between other powers in the region was undeniable.[^27]

The Dales were famous for a strong-willed breed of working pony, called the [Dales pony](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dales_pony "Dales pony"). On average they cost 120 [gp](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gp "Gp").[^28]

## Relations

Considering how the Dalelands were located at a crossroads between a number of different powerful human nations, city-states and even the renewed kingdom of the elves the fact their lands were brought to the attention of a several of the Realms' most influential powers came as little surprise.[^27] Among these groups were:

The elves of [Cormanthyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthyr "Cormanthyr") north of the Dalelands helped forge a friendship and fledgling alliance of nations long before the people of the Dales were a semblance of an impactful society.[^2] The Dalesfolk and the elves have maintained a respectful friendship over the centuries, even following the [Retreat](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Retreat "Retreat").[^21] Even though the Dales Compact did not stand for centuries between its initial iteration and its reformation in the 15 <sup>th</sup> century,[^20] [^4] the men of the dales knew to not challenge the ancient elven laws regarding the sanctity of the forest.[^21]

The typically secretive group of benevolent spies and agents known as the [Harpers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Harpers "Harpers") shared an similar outlook of the world with the Dalesfolk. The Harpers could operate more freely in the dales than they could usually get away with. They also counted many local leaders among their ranks including [Mourngrym Amcathra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mourngrym_Amcathra "Mourngrym Amcathra"), [Storm Silverhand](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Storm_Silverhand "Storm Silverhand") and even [Elminster](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elminster "Elminster"),[^27] who was famously known as the Sage of Shadowdale.[^29] Shadowdale indeed was home a great number of Harpers.[^27]

The [Zhentarim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentarim "Zhentarim") were arguably the most infamous and deadly of groups that the Dalelands would collectively declare as their enemy. Throughout the ages, the Zhentarim have spied on, maneuvered against, raided and outright invaded the dales, resulting in no small feat of the outright destruction of [Teshendale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Teshendale "Teshendale"), and intermittent occupations in Shadowdale [^27] and Daggerdale.[^30]

Along with these larger groups the Dalelands were home to a few more localized ones such as the [pegasi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pegasi "Pegasi") -mounted [Flying Auxiliary](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Flying_Auxiliary "Flying Auxiliary") that guarded High Dale,[^31] the [Silver Ravens](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_Ravens "Silver Ravens") of Sembia who led operations from Scardale Town,[^32] and the Stellar Fellowship, an adventuring society based out of [New Velar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/New_Velar "New Velar").[^4]

## History

### Origins

The smattering of [human](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") settlers that huddled in small villages at the edges of Cormanthor and [Cormanthyrian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthyr "Cormanthyr") led by [Coronal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Coronal "Coronal") [Eltargrim Irithyl](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eltargrim_Irithyl "Eltargrim Irithyl") came to an agreement known as the Dales Compact. The conditions of this pact gave the future-Dalesfolk non-forested, and non-elven claimed areas of land on which to settle and ceased any and all logging efforts deeper into the forest. Furthermore, the [Standing Stone](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Standing_Stone "Standing Stone") was erected as a monument to this new alliance between elf and man.[^2] This turning point in both civilizations also marked the beginning of the [Dale Reckoning](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dale_Reckoning "Dale Reckoning") calendar for centuries to come.[^33]

One of the most famous milestones in Harper lore occurred in the [Dancing Place](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dancing_Place "Dancing Place") within High Dale on [Flamerule 26](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Flamerule_26 "Flamerule 26"), in the [Year of the Dawn Rose, 720 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/720_DR "720 DR").[^34] The [Gathering of the Gods](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gathering_of_the_Gods "Gathering of the Gods") was a widely-celebrated event where good-aligned deities spoke directly through their respective priests on [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril"). This event led to the reformation of the Harpers, which was all but wiped out some six years prior.[^35]

In response to the growing threat of [orcish](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") tribes near the Dalelands, [Aencar Burlisk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aencar_Burlisk "Aencar Burlisk") was the Warlord of [Battledale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battledale "Battledale") in the [Year of Warlords, 1030 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1030_DR "1030 DR"). Over the next decade he would declare himself as King of the Dales, unite the Dalelands to defeat the common threat,[^3] and vigilantly defend them from others. Regrettably, he was slain in the [Year of Singing Shards, 1044 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1044_DR "1044 DR") by a [dracolich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dracolich "Dracolich") that was summoned while he feasted. The [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") dragon, and its summoner Alacanther, were defeated by Aencar's officers, and his body was interred in his manor and set alight.[^36] The Dalelands were split into independent communities that maintained somewhat an alliance [^37] through the [Dales Council](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dales_Council "Dales Council").[^21]

### Civil Wars

When the [Dusk Lord](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk_Lord "Dusk Lord") of [Sessrendale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sessrendale "Sessrendale") was suspected of corrupting the Dalelands with [dark magic](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancy "Necromancy") and pillaging caravans with monsters and evil marauders, the Dalesfolk of Archendale took action. The first civil war took place over three weeks in the [Year of the Weeping Wives, 1232 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1232_DR "1232 DR"), when the forces of Archendale assailed, and eventually annihilated the Dusk Lord and his mages. The [Three Swords](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Swords_of_Archendale "Swords of Archendale") then salted the earth of the dale so that nothing more could grow from its soil.[^3]

The [second war-between-dales](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_inter-dale_war "Second inter-dale war") fell under attempts of the Lord of [Scardale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scardale "Scardale"), [Lashan Aumersair](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lashan_Aumersair "Lashan Aumersair") to reunite Dalelands under a common banner in the [Year of the Worm, 1356 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1356_DR "1356 DR"). His forces managed to defeat Featherdale, Battledale and Harrowdale but were eventually stopped at Mistledale by a coalition of Dales powers and united soldiers from Cormyr, Hillsfar, Sembia and even [Zhentil Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentil_Keep "Zhentil Keep"). This defeat resulted in over a decade of occupation and influence from the governments of these respective powers.[^2]

In the [Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1374_DR "1374 DR"), The Dales Compact was renewed between the [crusading](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Seiveril%27s_Crusade "Seiveril's Crusade") [Seiveril Miritar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Seiveril_Miritar "Seiveril Miritar") of [Evereska](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Evereska "Evereska") and the untied lands of Battledale, Deepingdale, Mistledale and Shadowdale.[^38]

The [Cormanthor War](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthor_War "Cormanthor War") of the same year resulted in the invasion of Battledale and Shadowdale but ended with a hopeful outlook for the latter. Lord [Mourngrym Amcathra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mourngrym_Amcathra "Mourngrym Amcathra") was freed and lordship of the dale was passed on to Alazar Falconhand.[^39]

### Conflict with Sembia

Throughout 15 <sup>th</sup> century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), the Dalelands had become a focal point for several neighboring nations, all vying for control over its land and people. Tasseldale was overrun, Featherdale was annexed and the government of Archendale was discovered to have betrayed their people to Sembian coin.[^4]

## Notable Locations

Trading dales

These large, densely populated countries featured large cities that often had dealings with foreign powers. Their citizens were notably more urbane than their cousins from the rustic dales.[^40]

- [Archendale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Archendale "Archendale"): This large, mercantile autocracy was among the most aggressive and militaristic of the dales.[^9] Long-governed by the [Three Swords](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Swords_of_Archendale "Swords of Archendale"), this ruling body was found to be under Sembian influence in [1440 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1440_DR "1440 DR"). The Archendalesmen cast out those responsible for this treachery and cast into a common cause with the dales fighting to remain independent.[^4]
- [Scardale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scardale "Scardale"): The ancestral home of the Aumersair dynasty was home to a stalwart, resilient people who have endured over a century of war,[^41] foreign occupation by forces such as Sembia, [Hillsfar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hillsfar "Hillsfar") and [Zhentil Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentil_Keep "Zhentil Keep"), as well as a [disease](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shaking_Plague "Shaking Plague") that all-but wiped out their formerly-shining-jewel of a [capital city](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scardale_Town "Scardale Town").[^42]. The dale within [the Scar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Scar "The Scar") finally fell to Sembian influence in 15 <sup>th</sup> century DR and by extension fell under rule of the [Shadovar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadovar "Shadovar") of returned [Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netheril "Netheril").[^4]
- [Tasseldale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tasseldale "Tasseldale"): Long-standing rivals of Archendale, this collection of a dozen small towns of proud and politically-savvy craftspeople have always been influenced by the merchant nation to the south.[^43] Neighboring dalesfolk long-worried that Tasseldale would succumb to foreign influence and secede from the Dales Compact, or annexed as Moondale was in the 11 <sup>th</sup> century.[^25] On the contrary, the dale was overran by mercenaries from [Yhaunn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yhaunn "Yhaunn") in [1420 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1420_DR "1420 DR").[^4]

Transitional dales

These straddled the line between the larger, more influential dales and the more rural ones.[^40]

- [Deepingdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Deepingdale "Deepingdale"): A prosperous and welcoming land [^44] that best exemplified the unity and bond that was possible between [humans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") and [elves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elves "Elves").[^45] The dale earned its name from a vision of the Deeping Princess, [Imryll Eluarshee](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Imryll_Eluarshee "Imryll Eluarshee"), where humans and elves could unite and live in appreciation of the lore and culture of Cormanthor. It served as the *de-facto* home for elves on the mainland of [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn") following [the Retreat](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Retreat "The Retreat").[^46]
- [Harrowdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Harrowdale "Harrowdale"): This independent republic, the oldest and one of the wealthiest of the dales,[^47] saw increasing wealth and affluence as its rival Scardale furthered in decline.[^24] This prosperity led to a formal alliance with [Myth Drannor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myth_Drannor "Myth Drannor") in [1428 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1428_DR "1428 DR"), marked with the renaming of Harrowdale's capital city to [New Velar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/New_Velar "New Velar").[^4]

Rustic dales

These lands were quiet, often pastoral lands, that held true to their farming roots. They featured freeholds of large farms, small hamlets and quaint villages.[^40]

- [Battledale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battledale "Battledale"): Home to many of the Dales' grandest battles,[^23] the sparsely-populated lordship of Battledale remained fairly peaceful throughout the 14 <sup>th</sup> and 15 <sup>th</sup> centuries.[^48] They were forced to evacuate their long-standing capital city of [Essembra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Essembra "Essembra") after several trade conflicts with Sembia.[^4]
- [Daggerdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Daggerdale "Daggerdale"): Originally famous for its hospitality, the land formerly called *Merrydale* had longstanding conflicts with [Zhentil Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentil_Keep "Zhentil Keep"), had developed a weary and suspicious demeaner. That is, until the famed rebellion of [Randal Morn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Randal_Morn "Randal Morn") and the [Freedom Riders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Freedom_Riders "Freedom Riders").[^49] Even with the Zhent threat neutralized, community of farmers has continually had to contest with monstrous humanoids, [lycanthropes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lycanthropy "Lycanthropy"),[^4] and [vampires](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire "Vampire").[^49]
- [Featherdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Featherdale "Featherdale"): This quaint and peaceful stretch of farmland along the [River Ashaba](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/River_Ashaba "River Ashaba"),[^46] had repeatedly maintained its independence and avoided annexation by Battledale, Scardale and thrice by Sembia.[^17] It finally fell to the merchant nation in [1418 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1418_DR "1418 DR") after Sembian investors systematically bought out businesses and other interests.[^4]
- [High Dale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/High_Dale "High Dale"): A self-sufficient and lawful republic nestled at a strategic pass within the [Thunder Peaks](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Peaks "Thunder Peaks") on the route to Cormyr. The dale's remote location allowed it stay free from Zhent and Sembian influence,[^24] but isolated it from the support and aid of the [Dales Council](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dales_Council "Dales Council"). As such, High Dale reached out to Cormyr and aligned themselves with the Forest Nation in the early 15 <sup>th</sup> century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR").[^4]
- [Mistledale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mistledale "Mistledale"): This vast clearing deep within the forest of Cormanthor, was said to have been created by a star falling from [realmspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Realmspace "Realmspace").[^50] The staunch republic that formed over this verdant land was steadfast enough to defeat the Dale conqueror [Lashan Aumersair](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lashan_Aumersair "Lashan Aumersair") in the [Second inter-dale war](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_inter-dale_war "Second inter-dale war"),[^42] and gave way to a flourishing capital city, [Ashabenford](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ashabenford "Ashabenford"), that served as the seat of the reaffirmed [Dales Council](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dales_Council "Dales Council") following the restoration of the Standing Stone in [1425 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1425_DR "1425 DR").[^4]
- [Shadowdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowdale "Shadowdale"): Humble in size, but heavy with power, this lordship-nation was perhaps most famous for being home to the [archmage](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Archmage "Archmage"), [Elminster Aumar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elminster_Aumar "Elminster Aumar"). Many retired adventurers took up residence in the pastoral village that [shared the dale's name](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowdale_\(town\) "Shadowdale (town)") [^51] and defended its borders from [drow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow "Drow") invasions, agents of the Zhentarim and would-be conquerers.[^51]

### Fallen dales

- [Moondale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moondale "Moondale"): One of the first dales to join the Dales Compact, Moondale expanded rapidly and the booming nation readily allied itself with the Sembia. They were peacefully annexed by the merchant nation [^1] in [1070 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1070_DR "1070 DR").[^52]
- [Sessrendale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sessrendale "Sessrendale"): Founded in [880 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/880_DR "880 DR"), this country spanned the eastern face of the Thunder Peak mountains, living under the rule of the [Dusk Lord](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dusk_Lord "Dusk Lord"). They were destroyed by the superior forces of Archendale during the [Sessrendale War](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sessrendale_War "Sessrendale War") in [1232 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1232_DR "1232 DR").[^53] [^54]
- [Tarkhaldale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tarkhaldale "Tarkhaldale"): Also known as the *Lost Dale*, this remote land slowly declined, falling afoul to [orcish](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") and [goblinoid](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinoid "Goblinoid") tribes for decades. In [1360 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1360_DR "1360 DR") the dale came to be the home to the [saurials](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Saurial "Saurial"), a [scalykind](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scalykind_domain "Scalykind domain") race that had been recently transported to [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril").[^55]
- [Teshendale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Teshendale "Teshendale"): The northernmost dale was over-run by an [orc](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc") army, under influence of the Zhentarim, in [1316 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1316_DR "1316 DR").[^1]

## Inhabitants

In addition to their verdant valleys, that were rich with wheat, oat, and a variety of vegetables; the Dalelands were abundant with wildlife including game, fish and fowl. Sheep, pigs and cattle were often raised in the farmlands and the fields and forests were rich with rabbits, [deer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Deer "Deer"), [bears](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bear "Bear") and even woodchucks and porcupines.[^56]

Regions located further out from settlements, along the fringes of the dales, contained [trolls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Troll "Troll") and bands of [bugbears](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bugbear "Bugbear").[^57]
